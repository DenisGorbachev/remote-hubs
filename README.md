# Remote Hubs

***♫ You'll never work alone ♫***

Problem: you want to work remotely for a global company, but you don't want to sit alone at home. You also don't want to visit coworking - since everybody is working on a different project, it feels like you're in the same place, but not together.

Solution: you can join a "remote hub" of the company - a group of employees working on the same project at the local place. If the company has multiple remote hubs in different countries, you can travel between them, too.

Benefits:

* Have face-to-face conversations: ask for advice or get feedback.
* Feel yourself a part of a small united team.
* Move freely between remote hubs.
